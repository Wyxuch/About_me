  about:
    "I'm an aspiring full-stack developer, most preferably working with node.js. My journey with programming started in middle school. I loved the possibility of creating almost everything like with Lego bricks but more complex. I'm very friendly and love to chat so the chance of showing my projects online and watch people play with them and have fun convinced me to become a web developer. Besides programming, I love travels, music, and Star Wars. \n\nFeel free to text me through the form below, I have experience with various projects from websites through the app-script project ending on solutions for clinics. \n\nCurrently, I'm looking for a cheerful team or project I can work on.",
